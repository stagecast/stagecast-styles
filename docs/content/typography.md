# Typography

## Type scale

The typography scale is modelled after [Github's type scale](https://primer.style/css/support/typography) and designed to work for Stagecast's product UI and marketing sites. Font sizes are designed to work in combination with `line-height` values so as to result in more sensible numbers wherever possible.

Differently from Github Primer, font sizes don't scale down with mobile sizing.

| Scale | Font size: desktop | 1.25 line height | 1.5 line height |

| `00`    | 48px               | 60               | 72              |
| `0`     | 40px               | 50               | 60              |
| `1`     | 32px               | 40               | 48              |
| `2`     | 24px               | 30               | 36              |
